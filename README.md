# Powershell-Refactor
Does various refactoring for some modules I use that are fairly slow. Refactoring logic is based off Microsoft Learn Powershell performance considerations. Trying to make a bit more modular but particularly last 2 are tough without human intervention.

------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Analysis
- **PowerShellModule**
- - Integration with PSScriptAnalyzer for default rule enforcement.
- - Custom rules focusing on performance:
- - - Suppressing output to improve script efficiency.
- - - Array addition optimizations to avoid costly operations.
- - - Efficient processing of large files to minimize resource consumption.
- - - String addition considerations for memory management.
- - - Discouraging the use of Write-Host for cleaner and more efficient output handling.
- - - Minimizing repeated calls to functions to improve execution speed.
- - - Avoiding the wrapping of cmdlet pipelines to streamline data flow and processing.
- **Binary Module Consideration**
- - Depending on the nature of the tasks performed by the module, a binary module written in C# might offer better performance, especially if operations are compute-intensive or require advanced data manipulation beyond the scope of PowerShell's optimized use cases.
